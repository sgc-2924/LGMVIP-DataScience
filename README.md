Task 1 :-  Iris Flowers Classification ML Project :

Iris Flowers Classification ML Project : ( Begineer Level Task )

This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning.
The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms,
mainly how to load and handle data.
Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

Accuracy :- 95.5%

Task 2 :-  Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm :

Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm : ( Intermediate Level Task )

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to  predict the right class accordingly.
Accuracy :- 95.5%
